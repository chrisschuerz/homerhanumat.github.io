This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r carplot,fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3,fig.cap="A Plot of Cars"}
plot(cars)
```

A check for math:

$$\bar{x}=\frac{\sum{x_i}}{n}$$
